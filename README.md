# Module 1 Project - Iron-Hack

This project analyzes a set of data and returns conclusions, these can be seen graphically thanks to some plots that I have created to see better the information obtained.

## _Getting Started_

It is important that you know that this project is my first project, and the functions it contains are only useful for my dataset, since I have implemented methods like REGEX, which you can only use if your dataset contains the same as mine : )

## _Prerequisites_

You can see the requirements.txt file to get a better idea of what you will need, but a little above that I can tell you that I have learned to use the following:

Pandas, Regex, Mathplot, Requests, Numpy, BeautifulSoup...

## _Deployment_

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## _Built With_
