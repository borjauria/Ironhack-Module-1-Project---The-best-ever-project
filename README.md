# Module 1 Project - Iron-Hack

This project analyzes a set of data and returns conclusions, these can be seen graphically thanks to some plots that I have created to see better the information obtained.

## _Status_
This a beta version 1.2 of My First Project at Iron hack.

## _Getting Started_

It is important that you know that this project is my first project, and the functions it contains are only useful for my dataset, since I have implemented methods like REGEX, which you can only use if your dataset contains the same as mine : )

## _Prerequisites_ üíª

You can see the requirements.txt file to get a better idea of what you will need, but a little above that I can tell you that I have learned to use the following:

Pandas, Regex, Mathplot, Requests, Numpy, BeautifulSoup...

## _How to use it_ üîß

If you want to use it, you can create a _env_, install the libraries that you will find in the `requirements.txt` file, clone the whole project and use the dataset `borjauria.db` to check what I have done with this project. To execute it you will have to open in a console the file `main.py`

## _Built With_ 

A lot of work, implementation of improvements and above all, with a lot of love ‚ù§Ô∏è
   
## _Authors_
